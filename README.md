### About 
The program is written to simplify typing ancient greek on standard keyboards.
Without this program you have to go to a site, enter what you want to type, copy it, and paste it where you were typing.
Thats not very neat.

### Installation
1. Download the installer [here](https://github.com/StickyPiston-development/TypeGreek-Windows/releases/download/Installer/installer.bat)
2. Open the file.
If windows defender says "Your pc is being protected" click more info > run anyways. Windows defender says this because we didnt buy a 300$ license for a free program.
